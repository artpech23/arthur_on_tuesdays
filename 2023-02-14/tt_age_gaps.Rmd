**# Data preparation**



We need to create two subsets of the data in addition to the merged data frame as we will use them to construct different levels of the graph. The general idea of building *dumbell plot* using `ggplot` was taken from [this beautiful guide](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-extended-dumbbell-plot-ggplot2.html).


And yeah, I focused on Martin Scorsese movies only.

```{r}

         couple = str_c(actor_1_name, "-", actor_2_name)) %>% ## construct new names as some movies do repeat
  select(movie_name2, couple, age_difference, actor_1_name, character_1_gender, actor_1_age) %>% 
  rename(actor_name = actor_1_name,
         character_gender = character_1_gender,

I am bad at saving pictures and adjusting their sizes, so the result located at my github folder is not perfect. I will work on it in future! :)
