** About this week**

I enjoyed working with this dataset so much that it took me three additional days to finish my work. In my opinion, it is the case when the suggested data implies working with more convenient instrument (like *Tableau*) as it would be MUCH easier to drop interactivity & Ross's pictures via tooltip. At the end, the correspondence analysis I implemented (especially with a small share of variance explained) encourages viewers to dive into and take a look at the observations aka pictures. This missing part frustrates me but the resulted graph seems... fine to me.
